Landing Page Specification – PartShield
0. Context: What is PartShield?

PartShield is an innovative insurance product designed specifically for small and medium-sized machine shops. Every machining operation faces uncertainty from scrap, rework, and tolerance failures. These failures force shops to produce extra parts, adding hidden costs that eat into margins. To protect themselves, many shops inflate their bids with extra markup—only to lose jobs to more aggressive competitors.

PartShield solves this by insuring the financial impact of scrap and rework. Instead of carrying the burden of unpredictable losses, shop owners can transfer that risk to PartShield. This means they can quote jobs more competitively, reduce or eliminate unnecessary markups, and still be confident that their bottom line is protected.

The result is greater clarity and stability for workshop owners: predictable project revenue, stronger cash flow, and a competitive advantage in winning new business. PartShield transforms quality failures from an unpredictable financial hit into a manageable, insured cost—unlocking growth for ambitious manufacturers.
